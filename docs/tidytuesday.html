night","And prayed to God you'd be comin' home all right","And you would've been fine","We would have been timeless","'Cause I believe that we were supposed to find this","So, even in a different life, you still would've been mine","We would've been timeless","I had to smile when it caught my eye","There was one of a teenage couple in the driveway","Holdin' hands on the way to a dance","And the date on the back said 1958","Which brought me back to the first time I saw you","Time stood still like somethin' in this old shop","I thought about it as I started lookin' 'round","At these precious things that time forgot","That's when I came upon a book covered in cobwebs","Story of a romance torn apart by fate","Hundreds of years ago, they fell in love, like we did","And I'd die for you in the same way if I first saw your face","In the fifteen hundreds off in a foreign land","And I was forced to marry another man","You still would've been mine","We would have been timeless","I would've read your love letters every single night","And run away and left it all behind","You still would've been mine","We would've been timeless","'Cause I believe that we were supposed to find this","So, even in a different life, you still would've been mine","We would've been timeless","Time breaks down your mind and body","Don't you let it touch your soul","It was like an age-old classic","The first time that you saw me","The story started when you said, \"Hello\"","In a crowded room a few short years ago","And sometimes there's no proof, you just know","You're always gonna be mine","We're gonna be","I'm gonna love you when our hair is turnin' gray","We'll have a cardboard box of photos of the life we've made","And you'll say, \"Oh my, we really were timeless\"","We're gonna be timeless, timeless","You still would've been mine","We would've been","Even if we'd met on a crowded street in 1944","You still would've been mine","We would've been","Down the block, there's an antique shop","And somethin' in my head said, \"Stop,\" so I walked in"],"element":["Verse 1","Verse 1","Verse 1","Verse 1","Verse 1","Verse 1","Verse 1","Verse 1","Verse 1","Verse 1","Verse
