# Version Control

How many times when you are working finalizing a document and you save it as `final_15.docx` or something like `true_final_5.docx` or `FINAL_FINAL_3.docx` or `ONLY_LOOK_AT_THIS_ONE_FINAL_2.docx`. This is a common trait all of do to ensure that we save our updates so we can look at the differences between versions. This is where version control can help organize and track your changes between different versions of a file.

In this part of the book, we will demonstrate the basics of version control with the use of git and GitHub.
