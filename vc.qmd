# Version Control

How many times when you are working finalizing a document and you save it as `final_15.docx` or something like `true_final_5.docx` or `FINAL_FINAL_3.docx` or `ONLY_LOOK_AT_THIS_ONE_FINAL_2.docx`. This is a common trait all of us do to ensure that we save our updates so we can look at the differences between versions. This is where version control can help organize and track your changes between different versions of a file.

In this part of the book, we will demonstrate the basics of version control with the use of git and GitHub.

## Git 

Git is the system on a computer that will track changes of all the files in a specialized directory (folder) on your computer.

## Github

Github is an online platform the programmers used to store their code. Users can create repositories (a centralized back-ups) that can be updated and shared to other individuals. Imagine the Google Drive of programming.
