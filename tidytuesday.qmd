## Taylor Swift Data

The `taylor` package provides the `taylor_all_songs` and `taylor_album_songs` data sets that contain information on all of Taylor Swift's songs. Each data set contains basic information of songs (song release date, album releaser, ...) and Spotify API level data (danceability score, energy score, ...). You can install the `taylor` package with the following code:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
install.packages("taylor")

```

Access the data with:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

taylor::taylor_album_songs

## OR

library(taylor)
taylor::taylor_album_songs
```
