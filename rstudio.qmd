# RStudio

RStudio is an integrated development environment ([IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment)) that allows users to write code in a script and execute code to the R console in one application. Furthermore, RStudio has rich set of features that make data science projects easier to execute.

While RStudio has originally been used to program in R, it has been extended to program in python with the use of the [reticulate](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/) package.

## Installing

You can download and install the open-source (free) version of RStudio [here](https://posit.co/downloads/).

### Installing on Windows

### Installing on Mac

## Start-up

On start-up, RStudio will look like very similar to the image below:

You can see that there are 3 parts in RStudio, these are known as panes.

Additionally, we can add a fourth pane to RStudio for writing code in a text file. Choosing the white plus sign with a green border followed by a white document on the upper-right hand side:

This will open up a menu of text files that a user can choose to code in:

The "R Script" Button will open a standard R text file with the extension as ".R". This is the text file that most R programmers used to save and execute code. This will make RStudio to look like this:

Notice a new pane is created on the top-left that allows you to write R code in a script. This script is also connected to the R console below which will allow you to send lines of code from the script to the console to be executed (also known as [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop)).

## Global Options

In this section, here are some recommended "Global Options" for users to set in RStudio. To begin, click on *Tools* âžœ *Global Options* from the top-menu. The following window should open:

The window allows you to make several changes in RStudio that will make your experience better. Here is a list of items that are recommended for users to change:

1.  *R General*
    1.  Make sure "Restore .RData into workspace at startup:" is unchecked (**Highly** Recommended[^rstudio-1])
    2.  Set "Save workspce to .RData on exit:" to "Never" (**Highly** Recommended)

[^rstudio-1]: This will ensure that your environment is always recreated from the code you write and not from anything else. It increases reproducibility.

2.  *Code*
    1.  "Use native pipe operator `|>`" is recommended[^rstudio-2] (Optional)

[^rstudio-2]: The native pipe does not require to have any packages installed. Additionally, it executes code slightly faster than `%>%`.

3.  *Appearance*
    1.  In the "Editor theme:" box, choose a setting that you will prefer to work in (Optional)

4.  *Pane Layout* (Optional)
    1.  Change the pane layout to have the "Console" on the top-right corner
    2.  Add all components (checkmark) to the lower-right corner except for "History" and "Connections"

This will allow for you to expand the "Source" (script) to be expanded for the entire left hand side. It will allow you to view more code at one time.

RStudio will look more like this:

With the expanded script:

## Source, Console and Plots

The source pane allows you to write an R script for analysis. Below `x <- mtcars` is written (top-left) and executed to R (top-right). Afterwards the "Environment" Tab in the lower right pane now how `x`. The "Environment" tab displays which R objects were created and available to use for further analysis.

Since `x` is a data frame, clicking on `x` from the "Environment" tab will open a new tab in the Source pane containing the data set:

If we create an object that is a vector ( `y <- 4` as pictured below), the "Environment" tab now shows a new object as a value.

If a plot is created (`plot(mtcars$mpg)`), a plot will be displayed in the "Plots" tab in the lower-right pane.

The lower right-pane also contains other useful features such as access to your computer's file directory:
